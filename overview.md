Game setup:
    The player places each ship on the board
        Each players board is unique to them, so all spaces are available to place ships.
        Each ship can either be arranged horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
        
Gameplay:
    After placing all ships is done, the game begins
    Each player takes a turn
    For each turn, the players select a position on the enemy grid

    If there's a hit
        The location is marked as a hit
        The ship in that location registers a hit
        If all locations in that ship are hit, the ship sinks.
        If that is the last remaining ship, the player loses and the winner is announced
